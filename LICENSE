Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Program and such Derivative Works. This license grant is for all non-commercial, philanthropic uses, and further the only permitted commercial use under this license is strictly limited to the diagnosis, treatment, and/or cure of COVID-19. You may not use the Program for any commercial for-profit purpose other than the foregoing. 

##3.	Grant of Patent License. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Program, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Program to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program or a Contribution incorporated within the Program constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Program shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

##4.	Redistribution. 
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Program or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, in any form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

a.	You must give any other recipients of the Program or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

b.	You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

c.	You must retain, in any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Program, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

d.	If any portion of the Program includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the documentation accompanying the Program, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Program, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Program otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

##5.	Submission of Contributions – When Voluntary. 
In the spirit of furthering advancements in the diagnosis, treatment, and cure of COVID-19 on an urgent, global basis, submissions of Contributions that further that aim are strongly encouraged and welcomed by Lumeris. Any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Program by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

##6.	Submission of Contributions – When Compulsory. 
In the interest of improving the Program and thus furthering advancements in the diagnosis, treatment, and cure of COVID-19 on an urgent, global basis, if You (a) make and changes to the Program and (b) use the Program with those changes in the course of providing medical care, you must submit a Contribution that includes those changes. 

##7.	Trademarks. 
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of any Contributor, except (a) as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Program, (b) when reproducing the content of the NOTICE file, and (c) in referring to the Program by its official name, which is the Lumeris COVID-19 Predictive Analytics Program.

##8.	Disclaimer of Warranty. 
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Lumeris provides the Program (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Program and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

##9.	No Replacement for Professional Judgement. 
You acknowledge that the Program is not intended as a substitute for professional medical judgement or legal, accounting, or financial counsel, and Lumeris and any and all Contributors shall have no obligations related to any failure on Your part or that of individuals receiving access to the Program or results thereof to exercise such professional judgement or seek such professional counsel. Additionally, the Program may permit You to access medical information, data, records, and/or aggregations of data in a computerized, digital database intended to assist in the management of medical conditions, including specifically COVID-19, and You acknowledge that such content may contain errors, whether resulting from incorrect recording or transfer of information, software errors, or other causes. The Program is intended to be used only as a reference tool in assisting in managing Your own business and the Program is NOT intended to replace professional judgement. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE OR SUBSITUTE FOR THE ADVICE OF A MEDICAL PRACTICIONER.

##10.	Limitation of Liability. 
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Lumeris or any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. You agree to fully indemnify and hold harmless Lumeris and every Contributor for any claims made by any third-party which are related in any way to Your use of the Program.

##11.	Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. 
While redistributing the Program or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Lumeris and each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, Lumeris and/or such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

##12.	Governing Law. 
This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri. Jurisdiction for any disputes under this License shall rest in the Circuit Courts of St. Louis County, Missouri, unless all parties to any such dispute mutually agree in writing to an alternative jurisdiction.
